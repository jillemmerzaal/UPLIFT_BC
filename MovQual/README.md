## project description
This project is written with the soul purpose of working for the UPLIFT-BC project.

1) dynamic stability of movement as defined by the Lyapunov Exponent
2) signal smoothness as defined by the log dimensionless jerk
3) signal predictability with sample entropy
4) signal regularity with the autocorrelation
5) movement speed based on the repetitions
6) movement variability based on the repetions
7) movement variabilty from root mean square and root mean square ratio


## Instalation
Download the code from this GitHub page and put in in a folder that is ealiy accesible. 
Do NOT move the files into seperate folders, and keep the structure as is.
