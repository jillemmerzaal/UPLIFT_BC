# ULIFT_BC

## Overview 
 
The ULIFT task is a taks that has been found reliable in testing upper limb functionning.
This repository holds the code to calculate joint kinematics during an instrumented ULIFT taks. 
Within the ULIFT task, we will not be looking at movement quality 



Joint angles that will be extracted: 
- Scapula ab/adduction
- Scapula rotation
- Scapula flexion/extension
- Glenohumeral ab/adduction
- Glenohumeral rotation
- Glenohumeral flexion/extension
- Elbow ab/adduction
- Elbow rotation
- Elbow flexion/extension
- Wrist ab/adduction
- Wrist rotation
- Wrist flexion/extension
- Trunk ab/adduction
- Trunk rotation
- Trunk flexion/extension
