# ULIFT_BC

## Overview 
 
The ULIFT task is a taks that has been found reliable in testing upper limb functionning.
This repository holds the code to calculate joint kinematics during an instrumented ULIFT taks. 
Within the ULIFT task, we will not be looking at movement quality 



Joint angles that will be extracted: 
- Scapula ab/adduction laterale/mediale rotatie
- Scapula rotation protractie (interne rotatie) / retractie (externe rotatie)
- Scapula flexion/extension anterieure tilt/posterieure tilt

### note: for glenohumaral, XZY angles are taken
- Glenohumeral ab/adduction
- Glenohumeral rotation
- Glenohumeral flexion/extension
- Elbow ab/adduction
- Elbow rotation
- Elbow flexion/extension
- Wrist ab/adduction
- Wrist rotation
- Wrist flexion/extension
- Trunk ab/adduction
- Trunk rotation
- Trunk flexion/extension


## Maximal range of motion task
The range of motion tasks will be performed 3 times in a row with a pause 
- Glenohumeral anteflexie in sigital plane
- Glenohumeral ab/adduction in frontal plane
- Glenohumeral rotation in logitudonal plane 

## Cyclic movement 
12 weighted reaching repetitions in a single recording. Left and right. 
This data will be used to determine movement quality in terms of maximal divergence, movement smoothness, movement complexity and regularity.
