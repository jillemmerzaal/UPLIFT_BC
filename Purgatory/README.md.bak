# UPLIFT_BC Instrumented motion capture  

## Overview 
 
Three tasks will be performed: 
- ULIFT

The ULIFT task is a taks that has been found reliable in testing upper limb functionning. Is is a motion tasks that requiers people to move 3 weights from the upper
level to middel level(Phase 1); middel level to floor (Phase 2); floor to middel level (Phase 3); middel level to upper level (Phase 4). 

- Maximal range of motion task 

Active range of motion of the whole shoulder complex will be evaluated. 

- Cyclic weighted reaching task


  
#### This repository holds the code to:
Calculate joint kinematics waveform analysis during an instrumented ULIFT taks
Calculate peak angles during an instrumented ROM taks 
Calulcate movement quality during an instrumented cyclic weighted reaching task.




## Joint angles that will be extracted: 
- Scapula ab/adduction laterale/mediale rotatie
- Scapula rotation protractie (interne rotatie) / retractie (externe rotatie)
- Scapula flexion/extension anterieure tilt/posterieure tilt
- Glenohumeral ab/adduction
- Glenohumeral rotation
- Glenohumeral flexion/extension
*note: for glenohumaral, XZY angles are taken*
- Elbow ab/adduction
- Elbow rotation
- Elbow flexion/extension
- Wrist ab/adduction
- Wrist rotation
- Wrist flexion/extension
- Trunk Latro flexion
- Trunk rotation
- Trunk flexion/extension

## Movement quality parameters
- maximal divergence --> Lyapunove exponents
- movement smoothness --> LDLJ_A 
- movement complexity --> Sample enthropy 
- regularity --> autocorrelation
